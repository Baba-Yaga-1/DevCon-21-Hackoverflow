# DevCon-21-Hackoverflow

<h1 align="center"> Perry Bot </h1>

A simple discord bot that I created to cure the boredom and stress among the participants of hackathon.

I created this bot under Open Innovation part.

I used the Discord.py documentation as well as few APIs to generate information.

The first thing we have to do is make a discord account. Once weâ€™re finished, we will be redirected to the Developer Portal home page, where we have to create our application. After we make our application we will be redirected into a page where we will get information about our application.
For our code to actually be manifested on Discord, we will need to create a bot user. To do so, select Add Bot. By default, our bot user will inherit the name of our application. Instead, update the username to something more bot-like, and then Save Changes. Finally we have made our first bot. We then have to invite the bot to our server. We will see that the bot has been added but currently it is offline. For the bot to function we have to write some codes in python.
